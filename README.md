phantom-oblivion
===================

####**What is phantom-oblivion?**
*phantom-oblivion is an open-source framework that encapsulates python code and exposes it as an API over the internet, while preserving the anonymity of communications*.  

####**Why do we need phantom-oblivion?**
*Tackling privacy and anonymity on the web is a harder challenge than ever before. As a developer, I believe it is important to offer web services that protect the privacy and anonymity of communications that take place across computing nodes on the internet.*

####**How did I implement phantom-oblivion?**
The key idea behind phantom-oblivion is that of **Ephemeral Virtual Machines**.  Using this novel concept, it makes it easier to expose web services that are not tied down to being hosted on a single cloud provider and/or web server.
